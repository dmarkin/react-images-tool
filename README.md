This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project allows users to manage images. One of the key features
provided by this tool, is the ability to add images with tooltips. The tooltips on the images are
highlighted customizable. Users can customize the tooltips colour, text and position
relative to the image. The complete admin view includes the following:

1) see list of all images in a gridview
2) an "Add new image with tooltip" view, linked off the gridview
3) when user clicks on an image in the gridview, an image details view appears that contains
the one image + tooltip on hover;
4) an update selected image + tooltip text + tooltip position, linked from image details view
5) a "remove image" feature
6) server interaction emulation: all requests/responses have to be stubbed. It is possible to
unstub and change to real back-end.
